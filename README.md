# 4 Digit, 7-Segment Breakout FPGA
<img src="7-Segment_Completed.png" alt="PCB Completed" width="400"/>

This breakout board was created to be used in my Ohio University Master's course. We were required to build this circuit on a breadboard but I wanted to help develop my PCB design skills. This is a 2 layer board and has 4 M3 mounting holes to add standoffs. This was designed using KiCAD and the PCB was produced by JLCPCB.
